# WIP just-gridding
Kitchen sink example project for various GridField configurations, extensions etc.

Work in progress project for documenting Silverstripe CMS's GridField funcitonality.

Clone the project and explore yourself.

## How it could work

I suppose to have seperate classes / pages / modeladmins per feature shown. All relevant classes should be in it's own feature namespace.

Each feature should have a fixtures and demo data that's populated automatically on dev/build. Use "default_elements" for that.

## TODO
### General
  - [ ] ddev standard configuration
  - [ ] decide on a method to handle features and default data
  - [ ] do the stuff
  - [ ] have fun! ðŸ¥³
